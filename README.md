Module for rendering Next.js pages inside Next.js applications.

> **Note:** At the moment this package works only with Next **and** Fastify.

## Installation

This package requires to be installed in a Next application that is using Fastify as platform ([read more](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/performance)).

### Peer dependencies

This is the full list of peer dependencies:

- [Nest](https://nestjs.com/): `yarn add @nestjs/common`
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/): `yarn add fastify`
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/): `yarn add react react-dom next`

> **Note:** In theory you should install just `react`, `react-dom` and `next`
because `@nestjs/common` and `fastify` might be already installed.

### Install

Run: `yarn add nest-next-renderer`
